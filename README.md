# Personal Website

This repository contains a simple static website built with TypeScript. Content such as text, images and links is loaded from `data.json` so you can easily update your information.

## Development

Compile the TypeScript once by running:

```bash
npx tsc
```

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the page.
